/// SingletonScriptableObject by Nothke
/// 
/// A self-referencing ScriptableObject, useful for global game settings.
/// 
/// Example usage:
/// 
/// 1. Create a script like:
/// 
/// [CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "MySingletonSO", fileName = "MySingletonSO")]
/// public class MySingletonSO : SingletonScriptableObject<MySingletonSO>
/// {
///     public float myFloat;
/// }
/// 
/// 2. Create an asset in the Resources folder (IMPORTANT that it should be in Resources!!!)
/// 3. Now you can get the data from anywhere by using MySingletonSO.Instance.myFloat;
